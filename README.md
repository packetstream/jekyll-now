# PacketStream Blog

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
3. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
4. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve the website.
