In the modern day society, data is everything. Individuals aren't made of atoms; rather, they are made of data. In order to be successful, it is crucial for businesses to gather such data. It's not difficult to access data as there are free data available throughout the Internet. However, just as trends change rapidly, so does data. Businesses could use these freely available data, but they are most often going to be outdated. Consequently, businesses are required to gather data using their own tools for the most rapid changes. The basic two tools you need to scrape data are an atuomation tool and a proxy server.

In this article, we will delve into the necessity of a residential proxy server. The advangtages of residential proxies are numerous.

**Market Research**

Market research becomes harder day by day, especially if a buisness is trying to research its competitors' data. Most businesses take meticulous measures to protect their data from their competition, but there is a wall that prevents them from securing their data completely. The wall is consumers.

As a result, using residential IP addresses gives busiensses access to the protected data of competitors. When a business uses a residential IP address, the competitor's security sees an incoming request from a potential customer, rather than from a business competitor. 

For example, business A is an airline looking to compare its ticket prices from Canada to Cuba with other airlines. If business A uses a datacenter IP address, other airlines will detect that a business competitor is making a request to see the ticket prices and block business A from seeing their true prices. However, if business A uses a residential IP address, other airlines will detect a potential customer from Canada who is looking to buy round-trip tickets to and from Cuba. As a result, these airlines will freely show business A their true ticket prices.

**Ad Verification**

Brand safety concerns continue to rise in the world of marketing. One of the biggest issues with brand safety is ad verification. Creating and posting ads on an online space is not a cheap option; as a result, it is crucial for businesses to make sure that their ads are being placed correctly.

One of the problems that businesses can run into with ad fraud is the problem with hidden ads. Ads are hidden in many different ways. It could be hidden in a 1x1 pixel iframe; it could hidden outside a viewport area; or it could even be hidden among many other ads that are being shown on the same slot. As a result, this could lead to false showings of how accurate the advertisement is and inhibit a company from getting real insights on the effectiveness of the advertisement.

Another problem businesses run into is the problem of laundering. Laundering happens in a way that businesses cannot find out. Sometimes ads that are published end up in fradulent websites or websites whose contents and audiences do not match the advertising business' model. This results in ineffective and expensive advertising and could cause damange to the image of the brand.

By using IP addresses, businesses that run ads online can check up on where and how their ads are being posted. Fixing the problem with ad frauds is not a one-step process. However, using IP addresses to make sure the ads are being properly placed is the first step to creating a better protection for any possible ad frauds that could happen.
