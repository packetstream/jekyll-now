Residential IP addresses give businesses access to the data of its competitors. When a business uses a residential IP address the competitor's servers see an incoming request from a potential customer rather than from a business competitor. 

For example, Business A is an airline looking to compare its ticket prices from Canada to Cuba with other airlines. If Business A uses a datacenter IP address other airlines will detect that a business competitor is making a request to see the ticket prices and block Business A from seeing their true prices. However if Business A uses a residential IP address, other airlines will detect a potential customer from Canada who is looking to buy round-trip tickets to and from Cuba. These airlines will freely show Business A their true ticket prices.

**Ad Verification**

Brand safety concerns continue to rise in the world of marketing. One of the biggest issues with brand safety is ad verification. Purchasing media placements is not cheap and it's crucial for businesses to make sure that their ads are being placed correctly.
